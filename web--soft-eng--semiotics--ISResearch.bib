@book{Mika07,
  abstract = {We are not just building the Web any more: we are on it. The latest set of applications have transformed the Web from a mere document collection into a social space: the new services developed under the banner of Web 2.0 cater to our needs of connecting through the medium and allow us to explicitly describe, maintain and develop our online self. At the same time, documents and other forms of content are not only up- and downloaded any more, but actively exchanged, filtered, organized and discussed in groups of all sizes. While the pace of change is dizzying, investigating this complex social-technological system is paramount to our ability of designing intelligent information systems that can guide us through the new online universe. The book combines the concepts and the methods of two fields of investigation, which together have the power to aid in the analysis of the social Web and the design of a new class of applications that combine human intelligence with machine processing. Social Network Analysis and the emerging Semantic Web are also the fields that stand to gain most from the new Web in achieving their full potential. On the one hand, the social Web delivers social network data at an extraordinary scale, with a dynamics and precision that has been outside of reach for more traditional methods of observing social structure and behavior. In realizing this potential, the technology of the Semantic Web provides the key in aggregating information across heterogeneous sources. The Semantic Web itself benefits by incorporating user-generated metadata and other clues left behind by users.},

    abstract = {In this paper we describe TeleTruck, a multiagent dispatching system that was developed in close cooperation with a forwarding company and that is capable of handling real-world requirements like dynamics and uncertainty.  The main idea underlying the TeleTruck approach is the usage of <em>holonic</em> agents, i.e. agents composed of subagents that act in a corporated way. We describe the implementation in detail and point out the advantages of the holonic paradigm.},

    abstract = {A <i>holonic multi-agent</i> paradigm is proposed, where agents give up parts of their autonomy and merge into a "super-agent" (a holon), that acts - when seen from the outside - just as a single agent again. We explore the  spectrum of this new paradigm, ranging from definitorial issues over classification of possible application domains, an algebraic characterization of the merge operation, to implementational aspects: We propose algorithms for holon formation and on-line re-configuration. Based on some general criteria for the distinction between holonic and non-holonic domains, we examine domains suitable for holonic agents and sketch the implementation of holonic agents in these scenarios. Finally, a case study of a holonic agent system is presented in detail: TELETRUCK system is a fleet management system in the transportation domain.},
