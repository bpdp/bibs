    abstract = {In this paper we describe TeleTruck, a multiagent dispatching system that was developed in close cooperation with a forwarding company and that is capable of handling real-world requirements like dynamics and uncertainty.  The main idea underlying the TeleTruck approach is the usage of <em>holonic</em> agents, i.e. agents composed of subagents that act in a corporated way. We describe the implementation in detail and point out the advantages of the holonic paradigm.},

    abstract = {A <i>holonic multi-agent</i> paradigm is proposed, where agents give up parts of their autonomy and merge into a "super-agent" (a holon), that acts - when seen from the outside - just as a single agent again. We explore the  spectrum of this new paradigm, ranging from definitorial issues over classification of possible application domains, an algebraic characterization of the merge operation, to implementational aspects: We propose algorithms for holon formation and on-line re-configuration. Based on some general criteria for the distinction between holonic and non-holonic domains, we examine domains suitable for holonic agents and sketch the implementation of holonic agents in these scenarios. Finally, a case study of a holonic agent system is presented in detail: TELETRUCK system is a fleet management system in the transportation domain.},
